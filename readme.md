## Description

PaceBot is an experimental trading bot developed for research purposes. Operating on a 4-stage state machine, this bot dynamically transitions between states according to a specific algorithm. It determines its position based on the current state, enabling it to perceive market direction and make accurate predictions. 

PaceBot serves as a tool for users interested in experimenting with automated strategies for entering "LONG" or "SHORT" positions in the cryptocurrency market, particularly in assets like Bitcoin. With advanced algorithms, it aims to analyze market movements, and make accurate predictions.

## How It Works?
During the Computer Architecture and GPU design lesson, I saw a model which is a 2 bit branch prediction counter. 
In short, this model attempts to make accurate predictions by forecasting branching outcomes based on its current state.

You can check out this model more by searching "2 bit branch predictor" on Google.<br>
So, I though that the process of predicting the next branch state and the result of the transaction are similar. And tried to adapt this model on this trading bot.

The operational logic of the bot is as follows:

## Technologies Used

1. **Python:** The primary programming language driving PaceBot's functionality and logic.

2. **Binance API:** PaceBot connects seamlessly to the Binance cryptocurrency exchange through its API, allowing real-time access to market data and execution of trades.

3. **TA-Lib Library:** Technical Analysis Library provides essential functions for technical analysis of financial markets, aiding PaceBot in evaluating market indicators.

4. **ChatGPT:** ChatGPT, powered by OpenAI, is employed for code assistance, aiding developers in coding tasks and providing guidance on library usage. Additionally, ChatGPT is utilized for crafting informative log messages, enhancing communication and facilitating a smoother understanding of PaceBot's operations.

## Installation

To install Project, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Install Python:**  
	- Visit [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download python. 
	- I strongly recommend downloading a version lower than 3.10 and higher than 3 to ensure that you can download it without any issues and run the Talib library smoothly.
2. **Cloning the Project into your local:**
    Go to the directory where you want to download the project using 'cd', and then type the following command 
    ```bash
    $git clone https://github.com/basaryldrm06/PaceBot
    ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
    Enter these commands in sequence.
    ```bash
    $cd PaceBot
    $pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
Upon successfully completing these steps, proceed to configure your settings and run the program.

In case you encounter any issues, kindly attempt to resolve them before moving forward.

If you are facing difficulties downloading the Talib library, consider trying a manual download from this [link](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/).

## Configuration
Rename the file config2.py to config.py.

Open the config.py file to edit the settings, and fill in the empty fields according to your preferences.

</div>

If you do not have an api key you can obtain one from this [link](https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management)

You can use the default values for other sections or customize them based on your preferences.

Once you have finished editing your settings, you will be ready to run the program.

## Running the Bot
If you have completed the previous steps, PaceBot is now ready to run. Start it by entering the following command:

 ```bash
$python main.py
```

After running the command, you should see a screen similar to the one below.
